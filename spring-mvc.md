## What is MVC (Model-View-Controller)?

MVC (Model-View-Controller) is a software architectural pattern commonly used for developing user interfaces. It divides an application into three interconnected components:

- **Model**: Represents the application's data and business logic. It is responsible for managing the data, processing user input, and notifying the view of any changes.
- **View**: Represents the presentation layer and is responsible for displaying the data to the user. The view receives data from the model and renders it in a format suitable for the user.
- **Controller**: Acts as an intermediary between the model and the view. It receives user input, processes it (often by invoking methods on the model), and returns the output to the view.

### Advantages of MVC:

- **Separation of Concerns**: By separating the application into distinct components, MVC allows for better organization, modularity, and maintenance.
- **Testability**: The separation of business logic and presentation logic makes it easier to test individual components.
- **Reusability**: Components can be reused across different applications or modules.

## What is Spring MVC?

Spring MVC is a module of the Spring Framework that provides a comprehensive solution for building web applications following the MVC design pattern. It simplifies the development of web applications by providing robust infrastructure support for common tasks such as data binding, form validation, and view resolution.

### Key Features of Spring MVC:

- **DispatcherServlet**: The front controller that handles all incoming requests and delegates them to appropriate handlers.
- **Annotation-Based Configuration**: Supports annotations like `@Controller`, `@RequestMapping`, and `@ModelAttribute` for configuring controllers and request mappings.
- **Flexible View Resolution**: Supports various view technologies like JSP, Thymeleaf, and FreeMarker.
- **Data Binding and Validation**: Provides automatic data binding and validation support using `@Valid` and `@InitBinder`.
- **Exception Handling**: Offers built-in support for exception handling using `@ExceptionHandler` and `@ControllerAdvice`.

[Back to Top](#table-of-contents)

## Explain the flow of Spring MVC?

The flow of Spring MVC can be described as follows:

1. **Client Request**: A client sends an HTTP request to the web server.
2. **DispatcherServlet**: The request is received by the DispatcherServlet, which acts as the front controller.
3. **Handler Mapping**: The DispatcherServlet consults the HandlerMapping to determine the appropriate controller to handle the request.
4. **Controller**: The request is forwarded to the mapped controller, where the appropriate method is invoked based on the request mapping.
5. **Business Logic**: The controller interacts with the service layer to process the request and perform business logic.
6. **Model**: The processed data is stored in a Model object.
7. **View Resolver**: The ViewResolver is used to resolve the logical view name into an actual view.
8. **View Rendering**: The resolved view is rendered with the model data and returned to the client as a response.

## What is the front controller of Spring MVC?

The front controller in Spring MVC is the **DispatcherServlet**. It is a central component responsible for handling all incoming HTTP requests and dispatching them to the appropriate handlers, views, and other components. The DispatcherServlet acts as the entry point for the Spring MVC application and follows the Front Controller design pattern.

### Key Responsibilities of DispatcherServlet:

- **Request Handling**: Receives and processes incoming requests.
- **Handler Mapping**: Maps requests to appropriate controller methods based on URL patterns and request parameters.
- **View Resolution**: Resolves view names to actual views using ViewResolver.
- **Exception Handling**: Manages exceptions and delegates them to exception handlers.

## Advantages of Spring MVC Framework?

Spring MVC offers several advantages for developing web applications:

- **Separation of Concerns**: By following the MVC design pattern, Spring MVC promotes the separation of concerns, making the application more modular and maintainable.
- **Flexible Configuration**: Spring MVC provides flexible configuration options, allowing developers to choose between XML and annotation-based configurations.
- **Robust Infrastructure**: It offers a robust infrastructure for handling common web application tasks like data binding, form validation, and exception handling.
- **Integration with Spring Ecosystem**: Spring MVC seamlessly integrates with other modules of the Spring Framework, such as Spring Security, Spring Data, and Spring Boot.
- **Annotation-Based Programming**: Supports annotations like `@Controller`, `@RequestMapping`, and `@ModelAttribute`, making the code more concise and easier to read.
- **Wide Range of View Technologies**: Supports various view technologies like JSP, Thymeleaf, and FreeMarker, providing flexibility in choosing the presentation layer.
- **Internationalization and Localization**: Offers built-in support for internationalization and localization, making it easier to develop applications for global audiences.
- **Testability**: The framework promotes test-driven development by providing support for testing individual components.

## What is the main difference between Spring Core and Spring MVC?

The main difference between Spring Core and Spring MVC lies in their focus and functionality:

### Spring Core:
- **Focus**: Provides the core features of the Spring Framework, including dependency injection (DI) and aspect-oriented programming (AOP).
- **Components**: Includes modules like Beans, Core, Context, Expression Language, and AOP.
- **Use Case**: Used for building the core business logic and backend services of an application.
- **Configuration**: Primarily focuses on configuring and managing beans within the application context.

### Spring MVC:
- **Focus**: Provides a framework for building web applications following the MVC design pattern.
- **Components**: Includes components like DispatcherServlet, ViewResolver, HandlerMapping, and Controller.
- **Use Case**: Used for developing web applications with a clear separation of concerns between the model, view, and controller.
- **Configuration**: Focuses on configuring controllers, view resolvers, and other web components.

## Difference Between @Controller and @RestController?

`@Controller` and `@RestController` are both used to define controllers in Spring MVC, but they serve different purposes:

### @Controller:
- **Purpose**: Used to define a traditional MVC controller that handles web requests and returns view names.
- **Return Type**: Typically returns view names, which are resolved by a ViewResolver to render the view.
- **Usage**: Used in applications where server-side rendering is required, and the response is a complete HTML page.

```java
@Controller
public class MyController {
    @RequestMapping("/greet")
    public String greet(Model model) {
        model.addAttribute("message", "Hello, World!");
        return "greeting"; // returns view name
    }
}
```

### @RestController:
- **Purpose**: A specialized version of `@Controller` that automatically serializes return values to JSON or XML.
- **Return Type**: Returns data objects directly, which are serialized to JSON or XML and sent as HTTP responses.
- **Usage**: Used in RESTful web services and APIs where the response is data rather than a view.

```java
@RestController
public class MyRestController {
    @GetMapping("/api/greet")
    public ResponseEntity<String> greet() {
        return ResponseEntity.ok("Hello, World!"); // returns data directly
    }
}
```

### Key Differences:
- **View Rendering**: `@Controller` is used for rendering views, while `@RestController` is used for RESTful responses.
- **Response Type**: `@Controller` returns view names; `@RestController` returns data objects.
- **Serialization**: `@RestController` automatically serializes responses to JSON or XML.

## What is init-binder in Spring Web?

Init-binder is a concept in Spring MVC that allows developers to customize the data binding process for a particular controller. It is used to initialize WebDataBinder instances, which are responsible for binding request parameters to Java objects and performing data validation.

### Key Features:
- **Custom Data Binding**: Allows customization of how request parameters are converted to Java objects.
- **Validation**: Enables custom validation logic for binding and validating request parameters.
- **Formatting**: Provides support for custom data format conversions, such as date formatting.

### Example Usage:
```java
@Controller
public class MyController {

    @InitBinder
    public void initBinder(WebDataBinder binder) {
        // Register a custom property editor for date fields
        SimpleDateFormat dateFormat = new SimpleDateFormat("yyyy-MM-dd");
        dateFormat.setLenient(false);
        binder.registerCustomEditor(Date.class, new CustomDateEditor(dateFormat, false));
    }

    @PostMapping("/submit")
    public String handleSubmit(@ModelAttribute("formData") MyFormData formData) {
        // Handle form submission
        return "result";
    }
}
```

### Use Cases:
- **Custom Property Editors**: Register custom property editors to convert request parameters to complex types.
- **Custom Validators**: Add custom validators to validate request parameters before binding.
- **Date Formatting**: Configure custom date formats for binding date fields.

## Why do we need View Resolver in Spring MVC?

A View Resolver in Spring MVC is responsible for resolving view names returned by controllers to actual view objects. It acts as an intermediary between controllers and views, determining which view to render based on the logical view name.

### Key Responsibilities:
- **View Resolution**: Resolves logical view names to actual view implementations (e.g., JSP, Thymeleaf, etc.).
- **View Rendering**: Determines the appropriate view technology and renders the response to the client.
- **Customization**: Allows customization of view resolution strategies and view prefixes/suffixes.

### Example Usage:
```java
@Configuration
public class WebConfig implements WebMvcConfigurer {

    @Bean
    public InternalResourceViewResolver viewResolver() {
        InternalResourceViewResolver resolver = new InternalResourceViewResolver();
        resolver.setPrefix("/WEB-INF/views/");
        resolver.setSuffix(".jsp");
        return resolver;
    }
}
```

### Benefits of Using View Resolver:
- **Decoupling**: Decouples the controller logic from the view rendering logic, promoting separation of concerns.
- **Flexibility**: Supports multiple view technologies, allowing developers to choose the most suitable one.
- **Configuration**: Provides configurable prefixes and suffixes for view names, reducing redundancy in controller methods.

## What is the use of @ModelAttribute annotation?

The `@ModelAttribute` annotation in Spring MVC is used to bind request parameters to model objects and expose them to the view. It can be applied at the method or parameter level in controller classes.

### Key Uses:
- **Data Binding**: Automatically binds request parameters to model objects, making it easier to work with form data.
- **Pre-populating Models**: Allows pre-populating models with data before rendering the view.
- **Reusing Model Attributes**: Shares model attributes across multiple request mappings.

### Example Usage:
#### Method-Level @ModelAttribute:
```java
@Controller
public class MyController {

    @ModelAttribute("user")
    public User getUser() {
        return new User(); // Pre-populate model attribute
    }

    @GetMapping("/form")
    public String showForm() {
        return "form";
    }
}
```

#### Parameter-Level @ModelAttribute:
```java
@Controller
public class MyController {

    @PostMapping("/submit")
    public String handleSubmit(@ModelAttribute("user") User user) {
        // Process form data
        return "result";
    }
}
```

### Benefits of @ModelAttribute:
- **Automatic Binding**: Simplifies binding request parameters to model objects.
- **Reusable Attributes**: Allows sharing of common model attributes across multiple controllers.
- **Separation of Concerns**: Promotes separation of concerns by separating data binding from business logic.

[Back to Top](#table-of-contents)

## Are @Controller and @RestController stereotypes?

Yes, both `@Controller` and `@RestController` are considered stereotype annotations in Spring Framework. Stereotype annotations are used to indicate the role of a class in the Spring application context, providing additional information about the purpose and behavior of the class.

### Stereotype Annotations:
- **@Controller**: Indicates that a class serves as a web controller in Spring MVC. It is used to handle web requests and return view names.
- **@RestController**: A specialized version of `@Controller` that combines `@Controller` and `@ResponseBody`, indicating that the class is a RESTful web service controller.

### Benefits of Stereotype Annotations:
- **Role Identification**: Clearly identifies the role of a class within the application context.
- **Automatic Component Scanning**: Enables automatic component scanning and registration of beans in the Spring context.
- **Simplified Configuration**: Reduces the need for explicit configuration by providing default behavior based on the stereotype.

## What are the ways of reading data from the form in Spring MVC?

In Spring MVC, there are several ways to read data from a form and bind it to Java objects:

### @ModelAttribute:
- **Purpose**: Automatically binds form data to model objects.
- **Usage**: Used as a method parameter to bind form data to an object.

```java
@Controller
public class MyController {

    @PostMapping("/submit")
    public String handleSubmit(@ModelAttribute("user") User user) {
        // Process form data
        return "result";
    }
}
```

### @RequestParam:
- **Purpose**: Binds individual request parameters to method parameters.
- **Usage**: Used to extract specific form fields by name.

```java
@Controller
public class MyController {

    @PostMapping("/submit")
    public String handleSubmit(@RequestParam("name") String name, @RequestParam("age") int age) {
        // Process form data
        return "result";
    }
}
```

### HttpServletRequest:
- **Purpose**: Provides access to the raw HTTP request object.
- **Usage**: Used to manually extract form data from the request.

```java
@Controller
public class MyController {

    @PostMapping("/submit")
    public String handleSubmit(HttpServletRequest request) {
        String name = request.getParameter("name");
        int age = Integer.parseInt(request.getParameter("age"));
        // Process form data
        return "result";
    }
}
```

### Benefits of Form Data Binding:
- **Simplified Data Binding**: Automatically maps form data to Java objects, reducing boilerplate code.
- **Type Safety**: Provides type-safe binding of form fields to Java objects.
- **Validation Support**: Integrates with validation frameworks for automatic data validation.

[Back to Top](#table-of-contents)

## Validations in Spring MVC?

Spring MVC provides robust support for validating user input using a combination of annotations, custom validators, and binding mechanisms.

### Validation Annotations:
- **@Valid**: Triggers validation on the annotated object using the validation framework.

```java
@Controller
public class MyController {

    @PostMapping("/submit")
    public String handleSubmit(@Valid @ModelAttribute("user") User user, BindingResult result) {
        if (result.hasErrors()) {
            return "form";
        }
        // Process valid data
        return "result";
    }
}
```

- **@NotNull**: Ensures the annotated field is not null.
- **@Size**: Validates that the field has a specified size or length.
- **@Min / @Max**: Validates that the field has a minimum or maximum value.
- **@Pattern**: Validates that the field matches a specified regular expression pattern.

### Custom Validators:
- **Purpose**: Allows the creation of custom validation logic for specific fields or objects.
- **Usage**: Implement the Validator interface and override the validate method.

```java
@Component
public class CustomValidator implements Validator {

    @Override
    public boolean supports(Class<?> class) {
        return User.class.isAssignableFrom(class);
    }

    @Override
    public void validate(Object target, Errors errors) {
        User user = (User) target;
        if (user.getAge() < 18) {
            errors.rejectValue("age", "user.age", "Age must be at least 18");
        }
    }
}
```

### Benefits of Validation:
- **Data Integrity**: Ensures that user input meets specified criteria before processing.
- **Error Handling**: Provides clear error messages and feedback to users when validation fails.
- **Security**: Protects against malicious input and prevents potential security vulnerabilities.

## Annotations for Global Exception Handling?

Spring MVC provides annotations for handling exceptions globally across the application, ensuring a consistent and centralized approach to error handling.

### @ExceptionHandler:
- **Purpose**: Used to define methods that handle specific exceptions.
- **Usage**: Annotate methods within a controller to handle exceptions specific to that controller.

```java
@Controller
public class MyController {

    @ExceptionHandler(Exception.class)
    public String handleException(Exception ex, Model model) {
        model.addAttribute("error", ex.getMessage());
        return "error";
    }
}
```

### @ControllerAdvice:
- **Purpose**: Allows the creation of global exception handlers that apply to multiple controllers.
- **Usage**: Annotate a class with `@ControllerAdvice` and define methods with `@ExceptionHandler` for global exception handling.

```java
@ControllerAdvice
public class GlobalExceptionHandler {

    @ExceptionHandler(Exception.class)
    public String handleException(Exception ex, Model model) {
        model.addAttribute("error", ex.getMessage());
        return "error";
    }
}
```

### @ResponseStatus:
- **Purpose**: Allows specifying the HTTP status code to return when a specific exception is thrown.
- **Usage**: Annotate exception classes or handler methods to set the HTTP status code.

```java
@ResponseStatus(HttpStatus.NOT_FOUND)
public class ResourceNotFoundException extends RuntimeException {

    public ResourceNotFoundException(String message) {
        super(message);
    }
}
```

### Benefits of Global Exception Handling:
- **Consistency**: Provides a consistent approach to handling exceptions across the application.
- **Centralization**: Centralizes exception handling logic, reducing duplication and improving maintainability.
- **Flexibility**: Allows customization of error responses and error pages based on exception types.
